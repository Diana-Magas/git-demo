Running with bulls
Working my miracles
Holding my world together with a boot string
Living the dream
Benzos and gasoline
Coffee and blue light screens till the morning

[Pre-Chorus]
If I tell you this is drowning
You tell me I'm walking on water
I could bring fire from the mountain
You tell me it feels a little colder
I don't wanna

[Chorus]
Choose between being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older
Let me step a little bolder
Choose between being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders
Gonna be Nobody's Soldier
